Treasure Hunting

TITLE: Genetic Algorithm

DESCRIPTION 
Imagine you're going on a treasure hunt. Your bag can carry only a limited weight, but there are various items with different weights and values. The goal is to pack the bag with items that give you the most value without exceeding the weight limit. This type of problem can be solved using Genetic Algorithms.
In this problem we use the fitness function $f(x) = x^2$ to solve similar Genetic problem
